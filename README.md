# MCPE-Headers

These C++ headers are written to support MCPE 0.15.6. Some based are off of @byteandahalf's headers.

You may use these headers without giving credit.  
But if you do give acknowledgements to us for these headers, we wouldn't mind that either! =)

## How to use
#### Option 1: Git submodules
This method is only useful if you have code stored in a Git repository.

#### Option 2: Download and put in the mod
One of the simplest ways is to just download this repository, and copy the `minecraftpe` folder 
inside the `JNI` folder of your mod. However, you will not get the latest updates this way.
